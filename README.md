Remember to set up a virtual environment on your machine to ensure we're working from the same dependencies. 

To list your dependencies, run:
pip freeze > requirements.txt

And commit to your working branch (not the master! Check with: git branch) 

To install dependencies, run (after activating your virtual environment):
pip install -r requirements.txt
